# OrangeHRM Automation Project – Selenium with Python & Pytest

This is my real-time automation testing project for the OrangeHRM demo website.  
I used Selenium with Python and Pytest Hybrid Framework. This project helped me understand real-world automation framework structure.

## Note for Recruiters
I created this project as a fresher to learn how real automation frameworks work.
I used Selenium with Python and Pytest and followed proper structure like POM, HTML report, logging, and screenshot on failure.
This project helped me understand how automation works in companies.
I did everything by myself to practice and prepare for automation testing jobs.
