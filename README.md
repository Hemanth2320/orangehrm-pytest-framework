Selenium with Python Pytest Hybrid Framework â€“ OrangeHRM


# OrangeHRM Automation Project â€“ Selenium with Python & Pytest

This is my real-time automation testing project for the OrangeHRM demo website.  
I used Selenium with Python and Pytest Hybrid Framework. This project helped me understand real-world automation framework structure.

##  What I Did in This Project

- Used Pytest Hybrid Framework
- Followed Page Object Model (POM) for reusable code
- Automated login and logout functionality
- Added custom logging for tracking test execution
- Took screenshots on test failure
- Generated HTML reports using pytest-html

##  How to Run This Project

1. First install all required packages:
In terminal we use this command  pip install -r requirements.txt

Then we will run all test cases with this command:
pytest testcases/ --html=reports/report.html --self-contained-html

## Note for Recruiters
I created this project as a fresher to learn how real automation frameworks work.
I used Selenium with Python and Pytest and followed proper structure like POM, HTML report, logging, and screenshot on failure.
This project helped me understand how automation works in companies.
I did everything by myself to practice and prepare for automation testing jobs.
